# adhesome-prediction
Prediction of whether a gene is part of the Adhesome based on omics features.

The Adhesome is a set of proteins that form a complex network of interactions that together form the cellular processes of cell adhesion, migration and cytoskeletal organization [[1](http://www.nature.com/ncb/journal/v9/n8/abs/ncb0807-858.html)][[2]](http://www.adhesome.org)]
